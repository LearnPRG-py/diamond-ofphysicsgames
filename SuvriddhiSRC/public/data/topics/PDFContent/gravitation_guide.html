        <h1>Gravitation</h1>
        
        <h2>The Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>
        
        <p>The law of universal gravitation (propounded by Newton) says that a force of attraction exists between any 2 bodies. This is called the <strong>gravitational force</strong>. This force is proportional to the product of the masses of the 2 bodies and is inversely proportional to the distance between them (usually the distance between their centres of masses).</p>
        
        <p>Thus for 2 masses M<sub>1</sub> & M<sub>2</sub> separated by r, the above law for the force F states:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p>F ∝ M<sub>1</sub> × M<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p>F ∝ 1/r<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
            <p>F = (G × M<sub>1</sub> × M<sub>2</sub>) / r<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where G is the universal gravitational constant</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">G = 6.67 × 10<sup>-11</sup> N·m<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">The value of G is the same throughout the universe.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Vector Form of Gravitational Force</h2>
        
        <p>The law can also be expressed in vector notations as:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>F</strong> = G × M<sub>1</sub> × M<sub>2</sub> × <strong>r</strong> / r<sup>3</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where <strong>r</strong> shows the direction of the force</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>Note that the force is always attractive and acts along the line joining the 2 centres of masses.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Thus, the force F<sub>12</sub> exerted by body 1 on body 2 is directed towards body 1's centre of mass and F<sub>21</sub> exerted by body 2 on body 1 is directed towards body 2's centre of mass.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Newton's Third Law and Gravitation</h2>
        
        <p>As per Newton's 3rd law of motion, F<sub>12</sub> is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to F<sub>21</sub>.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Newton's Third Law Applied to Gravitation</h3>
            <p>F<sub>12</sub> = -F<sub>21</sub></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Action & reaction are equal & opposite.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Systems with Multiple Bodies</h2>
        
        <p>When we have a system consisting of multiple bodies and want to analyse the effect of forces on a particular body of mass m due to all the other bodies of masses M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, ..., we should consider pairs of masses with one of them being m such as (m & M<sub>1</sub>), (m & M<sub>2</sub>), (m & M<sub>3</sub>) etc.</p>
        
        <p>We compute the force on m due to each of the other masses in terms of magnitude and direction. A vector sum of all these individual forces will give the resultant force on m.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications of Gravitational Force</h2>
        
        <p>Several phenomena observed in nature are governed by gravitational forces of attraction & laws:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A body falling back to Earth when thrown up</li>
            <li>The movement of planets around the Sun</li>
            <li>The revolution of the Moon around the Earth</li>
            <li>The motion of all heavenly bodies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Inverse Square Law:</strong> The law of universal gravitation follows the inverse square law (F is inversely proportional to r<sup>2</sup>)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Worked Example: Finding the Mass of Earth (Based on D1.2 from Textbook)</h3>
            <p>The Moon has an average distance of 384,000 km (3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup> m) from Earth, and goes around the Earth every 27.3 days (2,358,720 s).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Based on the information given, find the mass of the Earth (treat Earth and Moon as point masses)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Take mass of Earth as M and of Moon as m.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">We have that the gravitational force of attraction provides the centripetal force:</p>
            <p>GmM / r<sup>2</sup> = mv<sup>2</sup> / r</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Cancelling m and multiplying both sides by r:</p>
            <p>GM / r = v<sup>2</sup></p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The velocity of the Moon in its orbit is:</p>
            <p>v = 2πr / t = (2π × 3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup>) / 2,358,720</p>
            <p>v ≈ 1022 m/s</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Therefore:</p>
            <p>GM / (3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup>) = (1022)<sup>2</sup> = 1,044,484</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Solving for M:</p>
            <p>M = (1,044,484 × 3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup>) / G</p>
            <p>M = (1,044,484 × 3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup>) / (6.674 × 10<sup>-11</sup>)</p>
            <p>M ≈ 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The calculated mass of Earth is approximately 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg</span></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">(The actual mass of Earth is 5.97 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg)</p>
