        <h2>Electrical Forces - Coulomb's Law</h2>
        
        <p>When we have 2 charged particles, each will exert a force on the other. This force is defined & governed by <strong>Coulomb's law</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
            <p>The force between 2 charged bodies is directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the 2 charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">This force is <strong>attractive</strong> if the charges are of opposite signs and <strong>repulsive</strong> if they have the same sign.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The similarity with the law of gravitation, except that in the case of gravitational force, it is always attractive.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Coulomb's Law (Mathematical Form):</strong></p>
            <p>F = k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> = the 2 charges</li>
                <li>r = distance separating them (measured along the line joining the charges)</li>
                <li>k = Coulomb's constant</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Vector Form of Coulomb's Law</h2>
        
        <p>The law can also be expressed in vector notations as:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>F</strong> = k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub> × <strong>r</strong> / r<sup>3</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">The direction of the force is given by <strong>r</strong> and for a 2 charge system, it is along the line joining the 2 point charges or centre of the 2 charges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>For two point charges 1 & 2, the force exerted by charge 1 on 2 is F<sub>12</sub> and that by charge 2 on 1 is represented by F<sub>21</sub>. As per Newton's 3rd law of motion which states action & reaction are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p>F<sub>12</sub> = -F<sub>21</sub></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Coulomb's Constant and Permittivity</h2>
        
        <p>The constant k is also written as:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p>k = 1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where ε<sub>0</sub> is called the permittivity of free space</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">ε<sub>0</sub> = 8.85 × 10<sup>-12</sup> C<sup>2</sup> N<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-2</sup></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Systems with Multiple Charges</h2>
        
        <p>When we have a system of charges and want to analyse the effect of forces on a particular charge (q) due to all the other charges (q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>3</sub>, ...), consider pairs of charges with one of them being q such as (q & q<sub>1</sub>), (q & q<sub>2</sub>), (q & q<sub>3</sub>) etc.</p>
        
        <p>We compute the force on q due to each of the other charges in terms of magnitude and direction. A vector sum of all these individual forces will give the resultant force on q.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Force Between Two Point Charges</h3>
            <p>2 point charges have charges of 4.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> C and -1.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> C, separated by 3.2 cm (0.032 m). What is the magnitude of the force of attraction between them?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>q<sub>1</sub> = 4.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> C</li>
                <li>q<sub>2</sub> = -1.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> C</li>
                <li>r = 0.032 m</li>
                <li>k = 9 × 10<sup>9</sup> N·m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>The force of attraction between them:</p>
            <p>F = k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p>F = (9 × 10<sup>9</sup> × 4.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> × -1.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) / (0.032)<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p>F = -0.0514 N</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The magnitude of the force is 0.0514 N, and the force is attractive, as represented by the negative sign.</span></p>

        <h2>Resistance in Circuits</h2>
        
        <p>An important concept in circuits is <strong>resistance</strong>. Resistance can help in reducing current going through components, in turn protecting them. This concept, with numerous applications has its own physics.</p>

        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
            <p>Under constant temperature and pressure conditions, the Voltage or potential difference equals Current times Resistance.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h2>Resistors in Series</h2>
        
        <p>If there are two resistors in series (one after another), let us say of resistance R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>, then the resistance is R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Series Circuit Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The current throughout the path is the same</li>
                <li>The potential difference (PD) across the resistors is different</li>

        <h2>Resistors in Parallel</h2>
        
        <p>If there are two resistors in parallel (in separate branches), assuming resistance of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>, the net resistance R can be found using:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Resistors in Parallel:</strong></p>
            <p>1/R = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub> + ...</p>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Parallel Circuit Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The current through each branch is different</li>
                <li>The potential difference (PD) across the resistors is the same</li>
                <li>More resistance will mean less current through the branch</li>
                <li>The net resistance (R) will be less than both R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Current Distribution in Parallel Circuit</h3>
            <p>A circuit with resistors of 5Ω and 1Ω in parallel will mean that most current will go through the branch with the 1Ω resistor.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Current takes the path of least resistance. Since the 1Ω resistor offers less resistance than the 5Ω resistor, more current flows through that branch.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> In a parallel circuit, the net resistance (R) will always be less than the smallest individual resistance in the circuit.</p>
