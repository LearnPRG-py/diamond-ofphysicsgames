        <h2>Bramah's Press (Hydraulic Press)</h2>
        
        <p>Bramah's press or Hydraulic press uses the principle of pressure transmission and force multiplier in a fluid to generate higher output forces for a relatively small input force. This is used extensively in the industry in multiple equipment like cranes to lift heavy loads with a lower force, machines to crush metal etc.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>The Principle</h3>
            <p>For an incompressible fluid, any applied pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid and in all directions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Pressure:</strong> Pressure = Applied Force / Area of application</p>
            <p>Pressure is measured in N/m<sup>2</sup>, also known as Pascals.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Incompressible fluids:</strong> Those where the volume and density do not change with change in pressure. Water is an incompressible fluid; oils are considered incompressible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How Hydraulic Press Works</h2>
        
        <p>Consider a hydraulic system with 2 piston-cylinder arrangements which are connected and filled with an incompressible oil. Let the area of the smaller cylinder be A<sub>1</sub> and that of the larger cylinder be A<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        
        <p>On the smaller piston, let us apply a force F<sub>1</sub>. Let the output force on the larger piston be F<sub>2</sub>. Let us find the relation between F<sub>1</sub> & F<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        
        <p>The applied force of F<sub>1</sub> on the small piston results in an applied pressure of P = F<sub>1</sub> / A<sub>1</sub>.</p>
        
        <p>As per the principle of equal transmission of pressure, P is transmitted equally throughout the fluid in this interconnected piston cylinder system. Thus, the larger piston is also subject to the same pressure P which results in a force of P × A<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Force Multiplication in Hydraulic Press:</strong></p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = P × A<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>P = F<sub>1</sub> / A<sub>1</sub></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> × (A<sub>2</sub> / A<sub>1</sub>)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Based on the relative sizes of A<sub>1</sub> & A<sub>2</sub>, the force F<sub>2</sub> gets multiplied several times over F<sub>1</sub>. This highlights the principle of the hydraulic press.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Hydraulic Car Lift</h3>
            <p>A hydraulic car lift has a small piston with an area of 0.02 m<sup>2</sup> and a large piston with an area of 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>. If a force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, what force is exerted by the large piston?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A<sub>1</sub> = 0.02 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>A<sub>2</sub> = 0.5 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>F<sub>1</sub> = 100 N</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> × (A<sub>2</sub> / A<sub>1</sub>)</p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = 100 × (0.5 / 0.02)</p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = 100 × 25</p>
            <p>F<sub>2</sub> = 2500 N</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The large piston exerts a force of 2500 N, which is 25 times the input force!</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Equation of Continuity</h2>
        
        <p>In fluids, mass flow rate is an important measure. A special class of fluids is <strong>incompressible fluids</strong> – one where the density does not change as pressure changes. Liquid (or fluid) like water is considered to be incompressible.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Equation of Continuity</h3>
            <p>In an incompressible fluid, the mass flow rate is same everywhere. This means when water (say) is flowing through a pipe whose diameter is changing, at any cross section of the pipe the same mass of water would flow past a probe every second.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Additionally, an incompressible fluid is one where the density does not change – this means given the mass flow rate is same and the density is constant, the volume flow rate will also be a constant at any cross section of the pipe.</p>
        
        <h2>Deriving the Equation</h2>
        
        <p>Consider 2 sections in the pipe at A and B. Let the radius at A be R<sub>A</sub> and at B be R<sub>B</sub>. Consider the velocity (speed) per second of the fluid (water) at A as v<sub>A</sub> and at B as v<sub>B</sub>. Let d be the constant density (which does not change since the fluid is incompressible).</p>
        
        <p><strong>The area of the pipe:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area at A = π × R<sub>A</sub> × R<sub>A</sub> = π × R<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>Area at B = π × R<sub>B</sub> × R<sub>B</sub> = π × R<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Volume and mass per second:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume through A per second = π × R<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>A</sub></li>
            <li>Mass through A per second = π × R<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>A</sub> × d</li>
            <li>Volume through B per second = π × R<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>B</sub></li>
            <li>Mass through B per second = π × R<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>B</sub> × d</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For an incompressible fluid (say water), the mass & volume flow rate at A & B will be equal. Hence:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p>π × R<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>A</sub> = π × R<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> × v<sub>B</sub></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">or</p>
            <p>v<sub>A</sub> × (R<sub>A</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = v<sub>B</sub> × (R<sub>B</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>General Form (for any channel shape):</strong></p>
            <p>Velocity at A × Cross sectional Area at A = Velocity at B × Cross sectional Area at B</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">or</p>
            <p>v<sub>A</sub> × A<sub>A</sub> = v<sub>B</sub> × A<sub>B</sub></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> When the cross-sectional area of a pipe decreases, the velocity of the fluid increases, and vice versa. This is why water flows faster through narrow sections of a hose!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Water Flow Through a Pipe</h3>
            <p>Water flows through a pipe with a cross-sectional area of 0.04 m<sup>2</sup> at a velocity of 2 m/s. The pipe narrows to a cross-sectional area of 0.01 m<sup>2</sup>. What is the velocity of water in the narrow section?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A<sub>1</sub> = 0.04 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>v<sub>1</sub> = 2 m/s</li>
                <li>A<sub>2</sub> = 0.01 m<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>v<sub>2</sub> = ?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Using the equation of continuity:</p>
            <p>v<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> = v<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>2 × 0.04 = v<sub>2</sub> × 0.01</p>
            <p>0.08 = v<sub>2</sub> × 0.01</p>
            <p>v<sub>2</sub> = 0.08 / 0.01</p>
            <p>v<sub>2</sub> = 8 m/s</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The velocity in the narrow section is 8 m/s, which is 4 times faster than in the wider section!</span></p>
