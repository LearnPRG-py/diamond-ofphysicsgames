        <h1>Sound Waves</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Sound?</h2>
        
        <p>We experience sound all throughout our daily lives, from the cars on the road, to music.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Sound is a longitudinal wave.</strong> This means that the direction of propagation of the wave and oscillation of particles are parallel. A sound wave also travels equally in all directions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Sound Wave Components</h2>
        
        <p>A sound wave has both a <strong>displacement wave</strong> and a <strong>pressure wave</strong> which are phase shifted by π/2 radians (90°). This means when one is at its minimum or maximum, the other is at 0.</p>
        
        <h2>Wave Velocity</h2>
        
        <p>For any wave, including sound waves, the velocity of the wave is the product of its frequency and wavelength.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Wave Velocity Equation:</strong></p>
            <p>v = λ × f</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>v = velocity of the wave</li>
                <li>λ = wavelength</li>
                <li>f = frequency</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Speed of Sound</h2>
        
        <p>Sound waves require a medium to travel through. The speed of sound in air is a constant <strong>340 m/s</strong>, or 1224 km/hr.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>For perspective:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>About 1.5 times the cruising speed of an average airplane</li>
                <li>About 3.5 times the speed of an F1 car</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Standing Waves in Tubes</h2>
        
        <p>When there is a tube:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An <strong>open end</strong> corresponds to a displacement antinode, but a pressure node</li>
            <li>A <strong>closed end</strong> corresponds to a pressure antinode, but a displacement node</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Node:</strong> A point where the pressure or displacement can't change</p>
            <p><strong>Antinode:</strong> A point where pressure or displacement can reach their maximum or minimum in a standing wave</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>As the name suggests, <strong>standing waves</strong> are stationary. This means that they do not propagate.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Tubes</h2>
        
        <p>Usually, we have tubes with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a.</strong> Both ends open</li>
            <li><strong>b.</strong> Only one end open</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The distance between 2 consecutive nodes or antinodes is half the wavelength (λ/2).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Tube with Both Ends Open</h2>
        
        <p>In a tube with both ends open, the length of the tube is equal to the harmonic number, multiplied by half the wavelength.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Tube with Both Ends Open:</strong></p>
            <p>L = n × λ/2</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>L = length of tube</li>
                <li>n = harmonic number (1, 2, 3, ...)</li>
                <li>λ = wavelength</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Combining with v = λf:</strong></p>
            <p>L = n × v / (2f)</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">This allows us to find L based on frequency and wave velocity instead of wavelength.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Tube with One End Open</h2>
        
        <p>For a tube with one end open, we use a different formula since it has a node at one end and an antinode on the other in the fundamental mode, making the distance ½ of λ/2 or λ/4.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Tube with One End Open:</strong></p>
            <p>L = n × λ/2 - λ/4</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">or</p>
            <p>L = (2n - 1) × λ/4</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>L = length of tube</li>
                <li>n = harmonic number (1, 2, 3, ...)</li>
                <li>λ = wavelength</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Combining with v = λf:</strong></p>
            <p>L = (2n - 1) × v / (4f)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Musical Applications</h2>
        
        <p>Standing waves have various musical applications. Instruments such as flutes use tubes open at both ends.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Flute Tube Length for Note A4</h3>
            <p>The note A4 is calibrated at 440 Hz. You are in a room with the speed of sound as 340 m/s. How long does the tube need to be to play that note in the fundamental mode?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frequency (f) = 440 Hz</li>
                <li>Speed of sound (v) = 340 m/s</li>
                <li>Harmonic number (n) = 1 (fundamental mode)</li>
                <li>Tube open at both ends</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the wavelength</p>
            <p>λ = v / f = 340 / 440 = 0.772 m</p>
            
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the tube length</p>
            <p>For fundamental mode (n = 1) in a tube open at both ends:</p>
            <p>L = n × λ/2</p>
            <p>L = 1 × 0.772/2</p>
            <p>L = 0.386 m = 38.6 cm</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The tube needs to be 38.6 cm long to play the note A4 in the fundamental mode.</span></p>
        </div>
